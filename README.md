# ThermalAndCoughHeterogeneousFusion
Heterogeneous Fusion of Acoustic Source Biometric Features and Thermal Source Deep Physiological Features for Accurate Porcine Cough Recognition: Improving Respiratory Health Monitoring in Pigs

# setup
The 'requirements.txt' file indicates the dependencies required for running the code.

In the first step, you need to be a credentialed user and sign the data use agreement for the project from http://yxm.imau.edu.cn/datalab/ website.

In the second step, you could download the data form the website using the credentialed username and password. The heterogeneous fusion dataset dataset detailed page is: http://yxm.imau.edu.cn/datalab/pig-thermal-and-cough-heterogeneous-fusion.

In the third step, according to the heterogeneous fusion dataset introdction, yUse the above code to complete the experiment.

And the project we bulided is used to heterogeneous fusion of acoustic source biometric features and thermal source deep physiological features for accurate porcine cough recognition, improving respiratory health monitoring in pigs

More details, you can see from the code above.
